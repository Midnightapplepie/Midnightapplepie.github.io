				<h1>Updating Site</h1>
				<h3>Novemeber 16, 2014</h3>
				<p>Spent the entire weekend redoing my site, reviewing the files found lots of stuff that can be removed. After removing a whole bunch of unless codes, I started adding some back in, then later start redesigning the site and got myself into an endless hole.</p>
				<p>It's a great review I have to say, as I was thinking about what to do with the background, I browse around for idea, I watch <a href="http://9elements.com/io/projects/html5/canvas/">9Elements.com</a>'s awsome video on youtube again and seeing how they can do amazing thing with html5 canvas, I somehow just started a project try to do a scaled down version of it. And it turn out to be an awsome project to review everything I've learned about Javascript so far.</p>
				<p>The project was to draw circles on canvas, great review for making objects, and give them random size and random motions. I have used constructor, prototype, created random functions, timed motions, and recreate methods like shuffle and rand from Ruby to make things easier for my project. After creating the canvase, I then wanted to incorporate that onto my site and that how I really started redesign mysite to fit the canvas. The outcome was a lot of work and frustration and great amount of satisfaction in the end. It was nothing amazing but in the end, I am happy with what I got and have gotten better understanding on JS than I did 2 days ago. It was great.</p>
