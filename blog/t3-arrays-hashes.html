				<h1>Array and Hashes</h1>
				<h3>October 2, 2014</h3>
				<p>Today I've learned about Array and Hash and would like to discuss their differences. To explain their differences, I will reference Ruby-Doc.org's definition for Array and Hash. According to Ruby-Doc.org, <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Array.html">Arrays</a> are defined as "ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object where indexing starts at 0". And <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Hash.html">Hash</a> is "a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also called associative arrays, similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type". These are great explanations for Array and Hash and letâ€™s take a look at what they looks like in Ruby.</p>
				<p>This is an example of an array: [1,"Apple",3,[2,5]]</p>
				<p>You can store any object into an Array and an Array is organized by indexing that starts at 0 and to better explain that, I will assign this Array to a variable called array.</p>

				<p>array=[1,"Apple",3,[2,5]]</p>
				<p>If I want ruby to return the first object in the array, I will call array[0], ruby will return (=>) the integer 1. If I want ruby to return the 3rd object in the array, I will call array[2], and 3 will be returned.</p>
				<p>To put an Array's indexing and it's relevant values together, it'll look like this:</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>Index</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>2</td>
						<td>3</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>array</td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>"Apple"</td>
						<td>3</td>
						<td>[2,5]</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>We can use array to store data such as scores of a test and use functions like "max" and "min" on the array to have ruby return the minimum and maximum score for the test. What if I want to store more than the scores? In addition to scores, I also want to store scores by name, age, and city of the person who took the test.</p>

				<p>If we are to use an Array, we could have something like this:</p>
				<p>test_result=[["Ken",90,33,"Santa Clara"],["John",78,22,"Daly City"]]</p>
				<p>This is an array with two objects which each is also an array with 4 objects that represents their name, score, age, and location. To access Ken's location, we will have to call test_result[0][4] and ruby will return =>"Santa Clara", assuming we know Ken's dataset index number and remember that the 4th object of the dataset is location. To write that instruction, it could be something like:<br>test_result.select{|i| i[0]=="Ken"}[0][3]</p>
				<p>That's not simple to use at all so we look to Hash. Hash is very similar to an Array and instead of organizing by index number, we can organize it with an object such as String which could be names of people who took the test. Let create a hash of the same data.</p>

				<p>Hash have a structure like this: {X=>Y}. What's in the position of X is called "Keys" and Y is called "Values". To create a variable with hash, we do variable={x=>y, a=>b}. If we do variable.keys and ruby will return =>[x,a]; an array of all the keys. And if we do variable.values, we'll have =>[y,b]; an array of all the values. If we want X's value, we will do variable[X], ruby will return the value Y. To use hash for the same datasets we have in the array example above, each "value" will be a hash itself too as follow</p>

				<p>test_result={"Ken"=>{"score"=>90,"age"=>33,"location"=>"Santa Clara"},"John"=>{"score"=>78,"age"=>22,"location"=>"Daly City"}}</p>
				<p>To access John's data, we call test_result["John"], and ruby will return: => {"location"=>"Daly City", "age"=>22, "score"=>78}. If we want John's location, we'll do test_result["John"]["location"], ruby will return => "Daly City". With the ability to associate each "value" to a "key" we can easily retrive data we want in Hash compare to Array. A good practice is to use Symbols as Keys in Hashes because it uses less memories, to learn more about Symbols, you can take a look at this <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Symbol.html"</a>Link.</p>
