				<h1>Stereotype Thread</h1>
				<h3>October 21, 2014</h3>
				<p>I watched the speech by Claude M. Steele about Stereotype Thread and can really relate to what he was talking about. Stereotype Thread arises depends on a person's self-identity at a particular environment. Technically everyone could have experienced it, such as when you are the only male in a group of females, at an older age among a group of younger age, or as a minority in a group. Differences give rise to stereotypes and it could be from the person themselves or from the environment, and it could have a negative impact on one's performance.</p>
				<p>My personal experience is at interviews. When I was interviewing for jobs that I have little or no experience in, I tend to perform worse compare to interviews for jobs that I have more experience in; even the interviewing questions were not difficult. Especially when the employer explicitly express less interest on inexperience candidates, my performance just drops because of that additional psychological stress. I am sure a lot of people can relate to this and I am very glad that Dev Boot Camp have brought this to my attention so I can think about how this can have a negative impact on my learning experience.</p>
				<p>I don't think that stereotype will ever go away and it will continue to have a negative impact on my performance here and there. What I can do at best is to be alert and combat this psychological impact when it arises. Some people I know have expressed their doubt on what I can achieve and I know how that had lowered my performance. I have more stress than I am supposed to. I remember when I first notice it, I began to hide plans that I have from a certain groups of people. And without those doubts, I was performing better. Then I realize itâ€™s all psychological. Now that I know, does it still negatively impact my performance? Yes, but I am better prepared for it mentally. And when people tell me what they want to do, I tried not to use words that carry any doubts and tell them to go for it. The solution to Stereotype Threat is very simple like Claude Steele had mentioned at his speech, just don't discourage people at what they are doing.</p>
