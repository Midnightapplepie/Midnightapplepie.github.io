				<h1>My Thinking Style and Learning</h1>
				<h3>October 3, 2014</h3>
				
				<p>After taking the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Personal Thinking Styles test</a> and read about the results, I laughed hard! Because it's very accurate, so accurate that it even points out things that I don't notice but true about myself.</p>
				
				<p>My outcome said that I have a <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">combination of Abstract Sequential and Concrete Random thinking style.</a> It's really on the spot about how I like to learn by trial-and-error, in competitive environment, and to be able to tackle a problem on my own first. And it also right about what I don't like and it really caught my attention as I wonder how they'll impact how I learn.</p> 

				<p>The result said I don't like restrictions, formality, routines, being repetitive, expressing myself, having too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly and not having an option. I have to admit, I have problems with all of that. I hate repetitive functions but I know sometimes doing a task over and over again is the best way to learn, I'll get frustrated but I've learned to turn those frustration into motivation to understand the task quickly and find new ways to do them so I don't get bored, then to simplify and eliminate them as much as I can so I feel like I have my revenge. I know well about my difficulties in expressing my ideas and emotions and I used to think that it cannot be changed and that's just who I am. But it's not true, although I still have difficulties in expressing myself, I have made improvements by stepping out of my comfort zone and slowly adapting it. I believe in the theory of <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Growth Mindsets</a>, where ability and intelligence in different subject matter can be improved through practice, efforts, accepting criticism and challenges.</p>

				<p>I used to believe that drawing is the only thing that I am good at and that I am not going to do well in other things like Math, Science, or dealing with computers and software (I used to hate computers). All it takes to change that is to accept one challenge and overcome it. I'm not an expert in anything but I have learned and experienced many things that I thought I never would, like being in sales, management, a degree in Finance, passed the CPA exam, and now learning about web development. All these things are what I thought to be very difficult for me to learn but I've challenged them. I am not better than others on the subjects that I've learned but I've proved to myself that I've learned what I thought I couldn't, and that just drives you to learn more and more. And through all these learning process I've learned to deal with my learning difficulties and you just slowly built a tolerance to it. I really don't have a concrete solution to all these learning difficulties but I'll try my best to make learning more fun.</p>
