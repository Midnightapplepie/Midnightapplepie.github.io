				<h1>Feedback From Pairing Session</h1> point: CMD Line, Sublime, think about preference, be more active, pseudocode
				<h3>October 19, 2014</h3>
				<p>It's great reading feedback from people you worked with. I always wondered what I could improve on cooperative sessions and feedback helps direct me to the things that I need to focus on. The most rewarding part from reading feedback is to know that others feel comfortable working with me, and that I was able to help solve some of their problems. Positive feedbacks are very encouraging.</p>
				<p>Reading feedbacks helped remind me about things that I need to work on. Things like getting more practice with command line and text editor, have better communication at the beginning of the session to learn about preferences, and be more active as a driver. These comments just hit me in the head and I know to improve them in the future. Now I always ask the person I pair with how detail they want my navigation to be, if they wanted general algorithm or detail codes. I've also asked if they feel comfortable with me commenting while they are navigating. I think these communication are very important because they really demonstrate respect to others.</p>
				<p>After receiving so many valuable feedback, I have to do my part and return the favor. It's always difficult to think of constructive feedback that the other person can improve on. And I always tried my best to provide at least one suggestion. I really think that constructive feedbacks are important and I hope I can get more of them. Knowing that there's things that you can improve on just keeps you going.</p>
