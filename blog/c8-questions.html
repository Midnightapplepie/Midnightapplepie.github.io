				<h1>Questions.</h1>
				<h3>November 16, 2014</h3>
				<p>I have experienced times when I didn’t get a response from my posts and questions. And I see why that’s the case when I review the posts I’ve made. Those posts were confusing. I did a lot of things that are bad examples of asking questions online such as bad title. People can’t get an idea about what kind of problem I have by reading my title while everyone agrees that a title should summarize the question that I have. For one of the post I made, no one will know what I was asking until they read the entire post. What I did was I titled the post with the assignment number that my class was working on and provided the link to my codes, and the rest of the post with details about my problem was not shown until others click into the link. Come to think of how I usually decide to response to a post is by reading the first few sentence and see if I can answer the question and read more into the post if I think I know the issue. It makes perfect sense that no one had responded to my post because no one knows what I was going ask about unless they have time to read more than the title, but as we all know that no one have time to waste so I failed.</p>

				<p>Reading more into my post, I found that some message was unclear. The post that didn’t get answer did not have a clear question for others to answer. I also found some grammar issue and broken sentences. I clearly wasn’t being careful when I wrote the post. Luckily, there are tons of resources online to help people like me improve the way I ask my questions online. On top of those posts about how to ask good questions, we can also examine what made us click and read more into an article on yahoo or Apps like Flipboard.  It’s all about the title and if that title capture someone’s interest. The next important thing is the first paragraph that will summarize the entire story so I know if I want to read more. This is how I choose if I want to read an article or not and I think this is how many will choose if they want to answer my question or not. So there’s really no secrete on how to ask good questions, it all about using common sense and being thoughtful that you are asking for other’s time and the best practice to ask for other’s attention is to be clear and to the point while being informative, just like those great articles we enjoy reading online.</p>
