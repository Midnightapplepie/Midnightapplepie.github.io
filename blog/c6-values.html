				<h1>Values</h1>
				<h3>November 2, 2014</h3>
				<p><strong>Values that makes me happy:</strong> Creativity, Free Time, Freedom, Simplicity</p>
				<p><strong>Most important value:</strong> Creativity</p>
				<p>This is very important for me because it makes everything less boring. I can be bored really easy and like to jump into action when I have an idea and then I will be so focus on the task and those hours of concentration are priceless because I am just so immersed in it. Creativity for me could be drawing some cartoons, creating a new work sheet at work, creating a process or playing video game in a specific way. I like it be because I am trying something new. </p>
				<p><strong>I try to live up to the values above?</strong><br>
				   Disagree 1------------5 Agree: 4</p>
				<p><strong>Last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</strong><br>
				Last time someone asked for my advice on if they should consider a change in their career.</p>
				<p><strong>How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?</strong></p>
				<p>I think it definitely helps because it reminds me who I am and what’s most important for me. As long as I still have a grasp of these values. I can survive. Creativity, Free Time, Freedom, and Simplicity all sums up to a little break and isolation from problems. Life can be stressful at times and for me being in long period of stress is not the efficient way to get things done. To stay efficient, I have to spend time doing what I enjoy the most. It’s the quickest recovery from any down time, I forget all the bad things after some fun.</p>
