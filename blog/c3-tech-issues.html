				<h1>Cyber Security</h1>
				<h3>October 12, 2014</h3>
				<p>I don't believe that anything is safe on the internet. There are all these talks about the huge amount of sensative personal data that companies like Fackbook and Google holds, and all types of privacy concerns that users have and that they should have. It's a uncomfortable feeling knowning that a profile of me on the internet is stored somewhere, with information about where I live, where I work, my contact information, people that I know, all the accounts and users names that I have for all the online services that I use and much more. I won't be suprised to find a detailed profile of me are being shared between companies and governement agency over the internet. I can't prevent that from happening because the internet make life much more convient and efficient that you have no choice but to supply your personal information online. So the bigger problem is how safe is your information over the internet? It's not safe at all. WE have companies throwing billions into security systems that prevent information from being leaked, yet it still happens often. Not just from small size companies but from big names like Google and how millions of Gmail accounts and passwords are leaked, Target with credit card information stolen of numbers in tens of millions, the list of big names of companies that got hack keep goes on. What is the solution? One of the solution I like was from Misha Glenny. He spoke on Ted talk about cybersecurity and suggested hire the hackers. Instead of solely pouring billions into developing sophisticated systems that will no doubt have loopholes, think about the benefits of profiling hackers, understand who they are, how the criminal network function, ways to identify them, or hire them if you can. I like the idea because as a society, we are spending so much money to defend them, why not spend money to hire them. I have to agree that hackers are a key component of security because they expose problems that exist in a system. They can help accelerate the identification of finding the loopholes. For techologies, you have to embrace the idea of failing fast. You build a security system, pay people to hack it or encourage people to hack it, then you fix it. This cycle goes on and on. For companies and government agencies which holds sensative, important information of the public, put their security system to the test. These companies and agency have to welcome frequent friendly attacks and make improvements along the way. At the same time, they have to understand the motivation behind these really smart hackers who love to break security system, and create opportunities to use them for the benefit of cybersecurity. And they have to understand the how cyber criminal network operates and how they make money. So the idea is, companies welcome attacks so they can accelerate security improvements, which increase cost of invasion. And make use of as much smart hackers as they can to reduce the opponent's capacity, and by understanding how their criminal network make money, find ways to reduce their profit margin. What about hackers that don't work for money and don't steal for money and passionate about exposing dirty secrets. We as a society should love them because they help maintain a balance of power.</p>
