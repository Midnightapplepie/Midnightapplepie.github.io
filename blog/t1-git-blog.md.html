				<h1>Version Control, Git and GitHub</h1>

				<h3>Sep 20, 2014</h3>

				<p>First week of Phase 0 at DBC, learned about PowerShell, Git and Github. I was told that work during phase 0 takes about 15-25 hours, that's about right but I think more time is needed to really enjoy the curriculum. So, I am getting the idea of time out of my head (except for assignment deadline :D ). I will also stop racing with the group as some of my classmates are really efficient and hardworking, knowing that they are ahead of me set me into a competitive mode and start to rushing through the curriculum, which I really don't think it's beneficial for myself. Here is what I can tell you about what I've learned so far about Version Control, Git and Github.</p>
			
				<p>1. 	Benefit of Version Control</p>
				<p>Version Control is like an undo button. You can go back to a point and restart from there. It's like you are saving a MS Word doc that you are working on to make sure your work is protected. The main differences is that each time you save your work, a version of the file is saved instead of saving over the original file, so you can go back to the 1st, 2nd or nth version you saved.</p>
				
				<p>2. 	Git and Version Control.</p>
				<p>Git is a popular Distributed Version Control System. Git clone a copy of the full project your team is working on into each member's computer as a local master file. This way everyone can work on any file of the project at any time offline. Any changes made to any file by a team member are track by Git locally. When changes are saved, Git will save a version of the entire project with changes locally, and then the entire copy will be sent over to the master project online to be merged when instructed. Changes are highlighted so it's easy to review by other team members who confirm the merge online at Github. This is very powerful and preferred by many group projects simply because each member can work on their piece anytime and offline. If the master project online at Github is lost, each member still have a full copy of the project, this makes it very difficult to lose things.</p>
				
				<p>3. 	Adding Github to the equation.</p>
				<p>Github is simply like a share drive where everyone put their work together. A team member can be in any part of the world and pull the most recent version of the project from Github and merge with the local version on their computer, do their job and send their copy of the project back to Github, their team can review all the changes made and approve to merge the changes to the master project at Github.</p>
				
				<p>If you are confused by my post or want to read more about Version Control, Git and Github, go read this: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started, a free book on this topic online by Scott Chacon.</p>
