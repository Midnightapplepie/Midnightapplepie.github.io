				<h1>Conflict</h1>
				<h3>November 7, 2014</h3>
				<p>I do my best to avoid conflict because they are just unnecessary and a waste of time. Conflict is just about who will win something so if I don’t need the win, I will give it up to avoid the conflict. I remember I was sharing a video on YouTube with one of my new friend at work; it was some funny clips of Jimmy Kimmel. My friend was offended because recently Jimmy Kimmel had another video where a kid raised a solution to kill all Chinese. My friend is Chinese and I am too and I think she’s over reacting to comedy. What triggers the conflict was obviously the video clip that I share and how later I was told to be ignorant and I should feel angry too. After hearing that, the conflict went on a little longer than it should, all because of a funny clip I shared.</p>

				<p>I was angry and couldn’t understand how one can be so upset by comedy. But I apologized, because continuing the conversation will make the matter worst. Because I was upset too and the apology was obviously insincere, we didn’t talk much for a few days and then things are back to normal again. I could have acted like I don’t know anything about the video that got some Chinese angry and apologize from there and would have avoided the conflict. It was nothing new to me, I had conflict over different personal values and expecting more in the future. My experience told me that it’s hard to change one’s personal value and it’s also hard for them to understand mine sometimes so I don’t try to win over such conflicts.</p>
